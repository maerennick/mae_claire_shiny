oyster,"The California oyster industry is the oldest aquaculture industry in the Western United States. Despite its age, California and the Pacific oyster industry have demonstrated some of the most innovative adaptations to changing times and changing conditions. The development of the hatchery system and re- mote setting of oyster larvae is a West Coast phenomena that has demonstrated economic advantage and has had international impact. Hatchery production has led to the development of broodstock development which will, in turn, result in improved lines of commercial oysters. The diversity of product and produc- tion of cultched and cultchless oysters using new production technology has stimulated new growth in the industry and has opened addi- tional growing areas. One of the more innova- tive adaptations has been the production of polyploid oysters, or sterile oysters with an extra set of chromosomes. Oysters that do not produce eggs or sperm do not develop a strong taste and remain in prime market condition well nto the summer months. These technical advances are designed to make the shellfish industry more competitive within the market place which will result in a stronger industry. Species cultivated include: Eastern Oysters (Crassostrea virginica); European Flats (Ostrea edulis); Kumamoto Oysters (Crassostrea sikamea); Olympia Oysters (Ostrea conchaphila); and Olympia Oysters (Ostrea conchaphila). Current methods used to farm oysters in California are beach or bottom cultured (or intertidal cultured), rack & bag cultured, longline cultured, and suspended tray or suspended lantern cultured. "
mussel,"Oysters have been farmed in California since 1929, but mussels have been farmed in Europe since the 13th century. With global demands in seafood increasing, mussel farming – a $3 billion global industry – is now emerging along the California coast.Mussels grow the most easily of all farmed shellfish,  as they are not susceptible to disease and can be harvested from 8 through 12 months after seeding.  The mussels are grown on continuous loops of suspended ropes submerged 20 feet below the sea surface and supported by floats to provide negative buoyancy for the crops.. They are incredibly nutritious; a single Blue Mussel contains only 290 calories, but has 40g of protein and 1,500mg of Omega-3 fatty acids. Species cultivated include: Bay/Blue Mussels (Mytilus trossulus); and Mediterranean Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis)"
clam,"Manila clam (Venerupis philippinarum), with 2005 production valued at over $19,000,000 (2005 Census of Aquaculture). However, all farmed species include: Littleneck Clams (Leukoma staminea); Manila Clam (Venerupis philippinarum); Geoduck (Panopea generosa)."
abalone,"Voracious grazers, these mollusks actively move and devour seaweed at an impressive rate along the West Coast.  This species of abalone is the largest in the world and with additional research, there is an opportunity to co-cultivate these with Giant Kelp in the open ocean suspending in cages above the kelp to provide a constant rich diet for this iconic high value marine crop. Species cultivated include: Pinto Abalone (Haliotis kamtschatkana); and Red Abalone (Haliotis rufescens)."
